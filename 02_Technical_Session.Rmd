## Before the Techincal Session {-}

**Sign up for [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/signup/)** Please do this as soon as possible! Sometimes it takes longer than expected to go through. It is free and requires a Google account. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/step-by-step-create-your-google-earth-engine-account-khang-vu-tien). Consider creating it "For myself", if you don't already have an account.
