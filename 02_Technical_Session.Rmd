## Before the Technical Session {-}

**Sign up for [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/signup/){target="_blank"}**. Please do this as soon as possible! Sometimes it takes longer than expected to go through. It is free and **requires a Google account**. Instructions can be found in the [Google Earth Engine Section](https://woodwellrisk.github.io/Nepal_Workshops/google-earth-engine.html) of this website.

## Planned Modules {-}

A .pdf of planned modules can be found [here](https://github.com/WoodwellRisk/Nepal_Workshops/blob/master/course_materials/Workshop_Invitation.pdf).

*Participants will be polled on preferences for Modules 1a-d on Day 2.

### Day 1 {-}

Before the session, make sure you have access to Google Earth Engine and download the [practice data sets](https://github.com/WoodwellRisk/Nepal_Workshops/blob/master/data/DataFiles-Technical_Session_Day_1.zip) for Technical Session Day 1.

**Module 1**	Ensure All Students Able to Log On (Darcy Glenn)

**Module 2**	Introduction to Google Earth Engine (Darcy Glenn)

* Upload files from computer & catalogue

* Basic commands

* Display data

* Calculate the number of days above 25°C (Demonstration)

  + Students can choose from 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, 40°C, or 45°C

**Module 3**	Recap and Q&A (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn)

### Day 2 {-}
Before the session, download the practice data sets for Technical Session Day 2.

Participants will be polled on preferences for Modules 1a-d. The Module selected will be determined by Day 1 of the Technical Sessions. This will give participants time to download data.

**Module 1a***	Using Daily Data: Projecting Extreme Heat Days (Darcy Glenn)

* Review projection methodology concept

* Wet-bulb temperature: Heat & humidity measurements are related to human health.

* Use Google Earth Engine to project days above 28°C wet-bulb 

* Export data

**Module 1b***	Using Daily Data: Projecting Extreme Rainfall (Darcy Glenn)

* Review projection methodology concept

* Precipitation: Extreme precipitation can result in flooding and affects infrastructure, agriculture, and water supply.

* Use Google Earth Engine to project changes in the amount of rain that falls in the top 5% of rainy/snowy days

* Export data

**Module 1c***	Using Daily Data: Projecting Night Temperatures (Darcy Glenn)

* Review projection methodology concept

* Minimum temperature: When the nighttime temperature is too high, our bodies cannot recover during a heatwave.

* Use Google Earth Engine to project changes to heat waves with high nighttime temperatures

* Export data

**Module 1d***	Using Daily Data: Who is Affected by High Temperatures? (Darcy Glenn)

* Review projection methodology concept

* Maximum temperature: Thresholds as seen in the Day 1, but now with daily data

* Import information from Google Earth Engine’s Catalogue to see who will be affected

* Export data

**Module 2** Recap and Q&A (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn)

### Day 3 {-}

**Module 1**	Participant-led map making

**Module 2**	How Risk Mapping Skills Can Help Society (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn) 

**Module 3**	Recap and Q&A (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn) 

**Homework** If maps are not complete for the presentation, you may need to meet outside of the workshop.

### Day 4 {-}

**Module 1**	Group Presentations

**Module 2**	Recap and Q&A (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn)
