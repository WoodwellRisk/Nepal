Planned Modules A pdf of planned modules can be found here. *Participants will be polled on preferences Day 1 Before session make sure you have access to Google Earth Engine and download the practice data sets for Technical Session Day One. Module 1 Ensure All Students Able to Log On (Darcy Glenn) Module 2 Introduction to Google Earth Engine (Darcy Glenn) Upload files from computer &amp; catalogue Basic commands Display data Calculate number of days above 25oC (Demonstration) Students can choose from 25oC, 30oC, 35oC, 40oC, or 45oC Module 3 Recap and Q&amp;A (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn) Day 2 Before session download the practice data sets for Technical Session Day Two. Module 1a* Using daily data: Projecting extreme heat days (Darcy Glenn) Importance of Ensembles Temporal Resolutions Review projection methodology concept Wetbulb temperature: Heat &amp; humidity measurement that can be related to health Use Google Earth Engine to project days above 28oC wetbulb Export data Module 1b* Using daily data: Projecting extreme rainfall (Darcy Glenn) Importance of Ensembles Temporal Resolutions Module 1c* Using daily data: Projecting night temperatures (Darcy Glenn) Temporal Resolutions Review projection methodology concept Minimum temperature: When the nighttime temperature is too high, our bodies cant recover during a heatwave Use Google Earth Engine to project changes to heat waves with high nightime temperatures Export data Module 1d* Using daily data: Who is affected by high temperatures?
