Using risk maps to inform climate policy requires skills in map interpretation and a baseline understanding of uncertainty inherent in climate simulations. Therefore, fostering the right skill set to correctly read and interpret maps of climate risk factors is a crucial aspect of risk science communication. To address this need, skill transfer and capacity buidling are an integral part of this study. To address this need, Woodwell Climate Research Center and Institute of Forestry and NRM, Tribhuvan University intend to engage with students/academics who are interested in learning the risk mapping process and the basic skills needed for interpretation. Goals of training Participants will be able to communicate how climate change will impact Province 1. Participants will be able to work with climate model data and create their own maps and visualizations. Participants will be able to use the data to help tell their stories. Learning outcome After the completion of the program, participants will be able to discuss risk maps and describe the process to their friends and community. Technical sessions ONLY - students will receive: Regional climate model data for Nepal Maximum temperature (daily) 1990-2019 and 2040-2069 Minimum temperature (daily) 1990-2019 and 2040-2069 Maximum wet-bulb temperature (daily) 1990-2019 and 2040-2069 Precipitation (daily) 1990-2019 and 2040-2069 Example codes that participants can use to further explore their own climate risk questions. Participant Commitment Participants are expected to attend all courses. If a participant cannot attend all courses, we kindly request that you do not enroll in the training to give the opportunity to other interested participants. All workshops will be held via Zoom. Please ensure you have access to the platform before the sessions. Technical sessions ONLY - Google Earth Engine is the only tool needed. Please follow the link below on how to ensure platform access: Google Earth Engine Requires a Google account Free to access, but requires signing up beforehand Future Participants Why wasnt I selected to join a session? There was an overwhelming interest in Reading and Creating Risk Assessment Maps. Unfortunately, we were unable to include everyone who expressed interest. The session schedule was determined based on the days that corresponded with most peoples reported schedules. From there, participants were randomly selected using a random number generator. We understand that this is not an ideal situation and are looking for ways to ensure everyone has the opportunity to participate in these workshops. What opportunities will be available in the future? All sessions will be recorded, and the course materials will be available via GitHub. We plan on having additional sessions in the future. If you wish to be informed when future sessions are announced, please sign up here. If you already signed up for the September sessions but were not placed in your preferred session, your email is already on the list of people to contact first when we have more information. Participants from the Institute of Forestry may also be able to act as a local resource.

Before the General Session Everyone: Please fill out your introductory form. This is to gauge participants interests and the workshops effectiveness. This form is anonymous, but critical to our ability to offer courses in the future. Thank you. Everyone: Please fill out your video &amp; photo waiver. The workshops will be recorded to help with future learning. Some stills from the sessions may be used for future marketing. Please fill this out even if you already answered the question on the anonymous introductory form. We need a waiver tied to your name. Everyone: Ensure you are able to log onto Zoom. Your calendar hold with the Zoom link will be in your inbox shortly. Technical sessions ONLY: Sign up for Google Earth Engine. Please do this as soon as possible! Sometimes it takes longer than expected to go through. Signing up for Google Earth Engine is free and requires a Google account. Instructions can be found in the Google Earth Engine Section of this website. Consider creating it For myself, if you dont already have an account. For those not comfortable in English: Consider downloading the General Session slideshow .pdf (coming soon). The speakers notes are written out in English as a form of subtitles. There will also be Nepali speakers on the call who can translate. Planned Modules A .pdf of planned modules can be found here. *Participants will be polled on preferences for Modules 3a-c. Module 1 Introduction (Bishal Bhardwaj) Module 2 Climate Change Risk and Mountain Development (Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Ph.D.) Module 3a* Components of Risk &amp; Reading Maps (Darcy Glenn) Discuss the three components of risk: Hazard Vulnerability Capacity Look at maps that show the three components of risk Identify components Discuss what is important and relevant on the maps Module 3b* Introduce What Climate Models Can and Cannot Do (Darcy Glenn) Importance of Ensembles Temporal Resolutions If time frames are too short, the results will not be accurate. Best practice is to look at data over a 30 year time frame. Spatial Resolutions Complex landscapes are better modeled with high resolution. Mountains are more difficult to model than flat plains. Very good at rates of change Overview of basic modeling methodology - conceptual Module 3c* Risk and Social Communication (Speaker To Be Decided) Module 4 Recap and Q&amp;A (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn) Powerpoints Powerpoints are coming soon.
