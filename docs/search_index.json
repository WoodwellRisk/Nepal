Using risk maps to inform climate policy requires skills in map interpretation and a baseline understanding of uncertainty inherent in climate simulations. Therefore, fostering the right skill set to correctly read and interpret maps of climate risk factors is a crucial aspect of risk science communication. To address this need, skill transfer and capacity bundling are an integral part of this study. To address this need, Woodwell Climate Research Center and School of Forestry and NRM, Tribhuvan University intend to engage with students/academics who are interested in learning the risk mapping process and the basic skills needed for interpretation. Goals of training Participants are able to work with climate model data and create their own maps and visualizations. Participants are able to communicate how climate change will impact Province 1. Participants are able to use the data to help tell their story. Learning outcome After the completion of the program, participants will be able to discuss risk maps and describe the process to their friends and community. Technical sessions ONLY - students will receive: Regional climate model data for Nepal Maximum temperature (daily) 1990-2019 and 2040-2069 Minimum temperature (daily) 1990-2019 and 2040-2069 Maximum wet-bulb temperature (daily) 1990-2019 and 2040-2069 Precipitation (daily) 1990-2019 and 2040-2069 Example codes that students can use to further explore their own climate risk questions Participant Commitment Participants are expected to attend all courses. We request participants who cannot attend all classes not to enroll in the course to give opportunity to other interested participants. Technical sessions ONLY - tools needed/how to ensure platform access: Google Earth Engine Requires a Google account Free to access, but requires signing up beforehand Future Participants Why wasnt I selected to join a session? There was an overwhelming interest in Understanding Climate Models. Unfortunately, we were unable to include everyone who expressed interest. The session schedule was determined based on the days that corresponded with most peoples reported schedule. From there, participants were randomly selected using a random number generator. We understand that this is not an ideal situation and are looking for ways to ensure everyone has the opportunity to participate in these workshops. What opportunities will be available in the future? All sessions will be recorded and the course materials will be available via GitHub. We plan on having additional sessions in the future. If you wish to be informed when future sessions are announced please sign up here. If you already signed up for the September sessions but were not placed in your preferred session, your email is already on the list of people to contact first when we have more information. Participants from the Institute of Forestry may also be able to act as a local resource.

Before the General Session Everyone: Please fill out your introductory form. The workshops will be recorded to help with future learning. Some stills from the sessions may be used for future marketing. Everyone: Ensure you are able to log onto Zoom. Your calendar hold with the Zoom link will be in your inbox shortly. Technical Sessions Only: Sign up for Google Earth Engine. Please do this as soon as possible! Sometimes it takes longer than expected to go through. It is free and requires a Google account. Instructions can be found in the Google Earth Engine Section of this website. Consider creating it For myself, if you dont already have an account. For those not comfortable in English: Consider downloading the General Session slideshow pdf (comming soon). The speakers notes are written out in English as a form of subtitles. There will also be Nepali speakers on the call who can translate. Planned Modules A pdf of planned modules can be found here. *Participants will be polled on preferences Module 1 Introduction (Bishal Bhardwaj) Module 2 Climate change risk and mountain development (Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Ph.D.) Module 3a* Components of Risk &amp; Reading Maps (Darcy Glenn) Discuss the components of risk Hazard Vulnerability Capacity Look at maps that show the 3 components of risk Identify components Talk about what is important on the maps Module 3b* Introduce What Climate Models Can and Cannot Do (Darcy Glenn) Importance of Ensembles Temporal Resolutions If time frames are too short the results will not be accurate Best to look at data over time 30 years is best Spatial Resolutions Complex landscapes do better with high resolution Mountains are more difficult than flat plains Very good at rates of change Basic methodology - conceptual Module 3c* Risk and Social Communication (Speaker To Be Decided) Module 4 Recap and Q&amp;A (Bishal Bharadwaj, Prof. Rajesh K Rai, Darcy Glenn) Powerpoints Powerpoints are coming soon.
